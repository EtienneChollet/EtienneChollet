# Hi there! 👋 I'm Etienne

I'm a biochemist by training, and software engineer by trade! 

# 🚀 Technical Skills & Subjects

My background has equipped me with the following skills!:

- **Software**
  - Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, PHP, & HTML.
  - Libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy
- **Chemistry**
  - Spectroscopy/Imaging/Analytical: 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, COSY, NOESY, HPLC, MALDI-ToF, gas chromatography, IR & UV.
  - Methods: Solid phase peptide synthesis, organic synthesis.
- **Biology/Biochemistry**
    - Cell culture, confocal microscopy, gel electrophoresis, immunofluorescence, mouse surgery (non-survival)

# 🏗️ Projects
My current research interests lie in computer vision, and the development of domain-randomized data augmentation strategies. The projects I am currently most excited about are: 

- [oct_vesselseg:](https://github.com/EtienneChollet/oct_vesselseg) A Label-Free and Data-Free Synthesis Engine and Training Framework for Vascular Segmentation of sOCT Data with PyTorch.
- [SynthShapes:](https://github.com/EtienneChollet/SynthShapes) A realistic 3D shape generator for biomedical image augmentation.
