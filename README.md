# Hi there! üëã I'm Etienne

I'm a biochemist by training, and software engineer by trade! 

### üìö Education
- **Fairfield University** (2017-2021): Bachelor of science in Biochemistry, Minor in Mathematics.
- **Yale University School of Medicine** (2021-2022): Visiting Student, Department of Surgery.

### üöÄ Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, Swift, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, & LaTeX.
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy

## üèóÔ∏è Projects
I am currently conducting research on the development of domain-randomized data augmentation strategies and computer vision. I am presently most enthusiastic about the following projects:

- [oct_vesselseg:](https://github.com/EtienneChollet/oct_vesselseg) A Label-Free and Data-Free Synthesis Engine and Training Framework for Vascular Segmentation of sOCT Data with PyTorch.
- [SynthShapes:](https://github.com/EtienneChollet/SynthShapes) A realistic 3D shape generator for biomedical image augmentation.
